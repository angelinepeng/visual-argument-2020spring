Asian Americans are known to be the model minority -- a stereotype that reinforces many Asian American and Pacific Islanders to feel heavy burden and pressure to meet specific expectations and standards set by the society that they live in. As a result, mental health issues have soared, especially in recent years. 

My visual argument seeks to highlight that we need to break the model minority myth, with a call to action to #remodelminority. #remodelminority is a hashtag trending on social media, asking the public to get rid of this ridiculous stereotype and the expectations placed on Asian Americans. 

To perpetuate the same narrative for such a diverse group of people is outrageous. 


For my art piece, I wanted to keep it simple yet noticeable. In my opinion, it is the most simple pieces that create the loudest statements. 
I used the color yellow in the negative space to lighten the mood, but also because of its significance for Asian Americans. 
It is the color of my skin [East Asian], a trait and stereotype that has been used to hurt us by others -- 
 but ultimately a trait that carries so much history, so many years of abuse from when the Chinese were basically enslaved to build the Trans-Continental Railroad, build America --
 a trait that we are so proud to possess. This was inspired by the Crazy Rich Asian's usage of Yellow by Coldplay, rewritten in Mandarin Chinese.
