Asian Americans are known to be the model minority -- a stereotype that reinforces many Asian American and Pacific Islanders to feel a heavy burden and pressure to meet specific expectations and standards set by the society that they live in. As a result, mental health issues have soared, especially in recent years. 

My visual argument seeks to highlight that we need to break the model minority myth, with a call to action to #remodelminority. #remodelminority is a hashtag going around social media, asking the public to get rid of this ridiculous stereotype and the expectations placed on Asian Americans. 

For my art piece, I wanted to keep it simple yet noticeable. I wanted to use playful and light colors to call attention, as well as share the side of Asian Americans that is creative. I took a photo of my friend, not smiling, to ensure that this movement is taken seriously still despite the playful background -- a juxtaposition. 

For further actions, I will need to include text. I am planning on using a simple font or my own handwriting. I want the text to be small and short so that people can read it easily.  I may add more colors to the overall background to see what works best. 

I guess what is important to me is that this piece is simple, but loud.
